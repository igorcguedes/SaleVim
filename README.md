REQUIREMENT: NEOVIM 9.0
Using the base config: Neovim From Scratch from https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch, numerous tweaks have been implemented to ensure optimal functionality with Apex, Aura, and LWC.

To ensure a smooth experience, make sure to install the necessary LSP servers, Prettier for formatting, and ESLint for JavaScript and HTML. The project aims to provide a simple, fast, and useful IDE, though it may currently lack some planned features. The focus is on low memory usage, instant loading for editing without waiting for plugin loading, and various optimizations.

Before proceeding with the installation, please ensure that you have made a backup of your existing configurations. Once you have confirmed that the backup is in place and empty, you can run the following command:

    git clone https:/github.com/igorcguedes/SaleVim ~/.config/nvim
    
Space is the Leader Key, you can use to Deploy, check keybinds, search for files and many more.
    
Prints:

However, there are still a few cool features missing, such as:
 
 • Diff files.
 
 • Salesforce org authorization (enabling switching between authorized orgs).
 
 • Creating files with sfdx, including Apex Classes, LWC components, etc.
 
 • Docker setup and compatibility with Windows (currently only tested on Linux).
