# Neovim from scratch

**Important Update** When I initially created this repo I didn't anticipate the amount of breaking changes, if you'd like to use the same basic config as this one as a base I recommend my new repo: [nvim-basic-ide](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide)

**Another Update** This repo should work fine with Neovim 0.8, also all packages are pinned so it should remain stable.

Each video will be associated with a branch so checkout the one you are interested in, you can follow along with this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ).

## Try out this config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

**IMPORTANT** Requires [Neovim v0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases). Please [upgrade](#upgrade-to-latest-release) if you're on an earlier version. 
```
git clone https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed. (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim) 

**NOTE** [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) is now used to install and manage LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters via the `:Mason` command.

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

- On Ubuntu

  ```
  sudo apt install xsel
  ```

- On Arch Linux

  ```
  sudo pacman -S xsel
  ```

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support

  ```
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support

  ```
  npm i -g neovim
  ```
---

**NOTE** make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, I recommend a node manager like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

### Upgrade to latest release

Assuming you [built from source](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#quick-start), `cd` into the folder where you cloned `neovim` and run the following commands. 
```
git pull
make distclean && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
git checkout v0.8.0
sudo make install
nvim -v
```
